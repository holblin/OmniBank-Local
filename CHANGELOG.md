## [1.1.7] - 2026-09-10

### Added & Improved
- **Forced Manual Bank Sync & 2FA Auto-Prompt 📱**: Manual clicks on 'Relevé en ligne' now immediately force online synchronization (bypassing the 3-hour automated background cooldown), automatically surface the interactive 2FA modal when strong customer authentication is required (e.g. Crédit Mutuel, Crédit Agricole), and auto-close upon mobile approval.

- **Pending Sync Balance Indicator 💡**: Unified balance status detection across the dashboard queue dock, overview cards, and review modal. When pending operations in the queue will resolve the balance difference, an intuitive "Conforme après validation" badge is displayed instead of an alarmist red discrepancy alert with an unnecessary adjust button.

## [1.0.94] - 2026-08-27

### Fixed
- **Recurring Operations Reconciliation Matching Priority 🎯**:
  - Fixed a bug where recurring transactions (e.g. monthly subscriptions like Google One, Netflix, rent) debited in the bank were falsely matched with the *previous month's* already reconciled transaction instead of the *current month's* pending forecast.
  - The reconciliation engine now simultaneously evaluates both pending predictions and already reconciled entries and compares their confidence scores, ensuring that close un-reconciled forecasts take precedence over distant past duplicates.
  - Automatically persists the unique bank hash (`csv_id`) on matched database records upon review confirmation for instant, 100% exact matching on subsequent synchronizations.

## [1.0.93] - 2026-08-26

## [1.0.92] - 2026-08-26

### Added & Improved
- **Multi-Criteria Reconciliation Matching Engine 🎯**:
  - Replaced the greedy first-come-first-served matching algorithm with a composite scoring system (0-100 pts) evaluating exact amount, asymmetric temporal proximity (0-35 pts), and normalized merchant/text similarity (0-25 pts).
  - Absolute priority matching on bank unique transaction identifier/hash (`csv_id`) prevents false match stealing across identical recurring amounts.
  - Tightened asymmetric matching window (-7d to +3d for confirmed debits) completely eliminates anachronistic matching where past bank debits would claim future planned forecasts.
  - Added an on-demand confidence score toggle badge (`🎯 Scores`) in the Bank Review Cockpit with explanatory tooltip, displaying color-coded trust levels (`🟢 85`, `🟡 55`, `🔴 42`) without visual clutter.
- **Improved Coming Operations Lifecycle ⏳**:

  - Neutralized popup interference during automated test runs.

### Fixed
- **Tauri Desktop Black Screen After Changelog Popup 🖥️**:
  - Fixed a critical issue where the desktop app (Tauri WebView) would display a black screen after the changelog popup, caused by the restrictive Content Security Policy blocking CDN resources (Chart.js, fonts, etc.) in the WebView2 context.
  - Relaxed CSP to permissive mode since all traffic is strictly local.
  - Added `try/finally` safety net in `_initUI()` guaranteeing the UI container is always revealed even if initialization encounters an error.
  - Injected a fallback timer in `main.rs` that force-reveals the UI after 5 seconds as a last-resort recovery.
  - Increased WebView navigation wait from 200ms to 2000ms for reliable CDN script loading.

## [1.0.90] - 2026-08-25

### Added & Improved
- **Unified Multi-Account File Import (CSV/Excel) into Bank Sync Queue 📄↔📥**:
  - Automatically detects all distinct account and savings sections (Compte Courant, Livret A, LDD, etc.) within a single bank export file.
  - Deposits extracted transactions directly into the pending synchronization holding queue (`_PENDING_SYNC_DATA`, `conn_id = -1`, `📄 Relevé importé`), allowing immediate ghost operation management on the Dashboard and Overview.
  - Multi-tab review cockpit allows seamless account switching, individual exclusion, and zero-reload commit with full audit log tracking (`created_by: "Import Relevé"`).

## [1.0.89] - 2026-08-24

### Added & Improved
- **Visual Hierarchy & Color Harmonization 🎨**:
  - **Calmed Reconciliation Badges**: Replaced heavy neon green/purple solid gradients on matched transactions with subtle, premium tinted pills (`rgba(16, 185, 129, 0.12)`), preventing the table from feeling like a wall of bright green buttons.

  - **Master Account Highlight & Pastille Visibility**: Added vivid account color pastille dots (`●`) inside all account badges across Dashboard, Timeline, All Operations, and the Bank Sync ghost balance bars, ensuring the master account's custom color stands out cleanly without competing against saturated neighbor elements.
  - **Discreet Table Row Actions**: Replaced permanent red `✕` delete buttons on every row with subtle ghost icon buttons revealed smoothly on row hover (`.row-actions-group`), eliminating the noisy vertical red strip on desktop.
  - **Strict Vertical Alignment on Action Buttons**: Reserved a dedicated invisible 26px placeholder for non-recurrent rows and standardized widths so duplicate, edit (`Modifier`), and delete buttons align strictly column-by-column across every row.
  - **Review Cockpit Column Balancing**: Expanded the Action column to 250px so helper descriptions stay on a single line and balanced the description column width.
  - **Ghost Row Smart Category Persistence 🧠**: Added in-memory session cache (`_ghostCategoryCache`) and unblocked Smart Label resolution so suggested categories (`Amazon`, etc.) remain visible even when navigating between tabs and reloading Dashboard data without requiring a full browser refresh (F5).
  - **Manual Link Modal Improvements 🔗**: Displayed original bank label (`🏦`) and custom account badge for DB candidates, and fixed category dropdown population and selection when linking operations.
  - **Unified Sync Banner Hierarchy**: Standardized primary vs secondary action buttons in the bank sync queue banner, softened `Soldes conformes` badges into elegant status indicators, and embedded account color pastilles directly in front of each account balance row.
- **Unified Review Cockpit — CSV Import merged into Bank Sync Review 📄↔📥**:
  - CSV/XLSX file import now opens the same advanced review cockpit used for bank sync, gaining all features: checkboxes, link 🔗 / unlink ⛓️‍💥 buttons, category autocomplete with AI batch, Smart Label suggestions, and status filter bar.
  - Dynamic title and subtitle adapt to context: "Import de Relevé Bancaire" vs "Revue des opérations synchronisées".
  - CSV-specific bar with account selector, file balance badge, and import alerts (old file, gaps, duplicates) shown only in import mode.
  - Commit routing is transparent: import mode calls `save_batch`, sync mode calls bank sync commit endpoint.
  - Background AI analysis for CSV still supported with dismiss/re-open workflow.
- **Purge Sync Queue Button 🗑️**:
  - Added a "Vider le sas" button in the pending sync bar to clear all cached previews, pending ghost operations, and match overrides in a single click (with confirmation prompt).
  - New backend endpoint `POST /api/bank-sync/purge-pending` clears the server-side sync queue. Frontend also clears all `sessionStorage` cache keys.
- **Interactive Unlink & Re-Link in Bank Sync Review ⛓️‍💥🔗**:
  - Added an "Unlink" (`⛓️‍💥`) action button on automatically matched transactions (`⚡ To Reconcile`) inside the Bank Sync Review modal to unbind false-positive matches (e.g. unrelated transactions sharing the same amount and date window).
  - Added a "Link" (`🔗`) action button on unmatched online operations (`🆕 New Operation` and `⏳ Coming / Pending`) to manually bind them to existing database entries via the interactive search and conflict resolution modal.
  - Implemented persistent dual-override architecture (`rejected_matches` and `force_matches`) stored in `sessionStorage` and transmitted to the real-time `/re-evaluate-preview` backend engine, ensuring manual unlink and re-link decisions persist across browser reloads (F5), page navigations, and live database recalculations until committed.
  - Added per-row inclusion checkboxes and a master select-all header checkbox in the review modal, allowing users to uncheck specific operations to skip them during sync commit.
  - Preserved uncommitted/unchecked operations in the pending sync queue and preview cache upon partial commit, allowing remaining suggestions to stay visible in the ghost box.
  - Added assisted description input with autocompletion dropdown (`<datalist>`) and instant category auto-fill from transaction history directly within the review modal inline inputs.
  - Increased desktop review modal maximum width to 1550px for comfortable multi-column transaction inspection, smart label details, and inline edits on wide displays.
- **Manual Ghost-to-Database Transaction Linking 🔗**:
  - Added a fast manual linking mechanism for online ghost transactions that failed automatic matching due to user-entered amount discrepancies, distant dates, or ambiguous matches.
  - Interactive search modal with live search by description, category, or amount, with an optional filter for unreconciled operations.
  - Ordered search results in chronological ascending order (earliest/closest dates first) so operations from the active period appear right at the top instead of distant future recurrence projections.
  - Smart field conflict resolution: allows one-click source toggling between OmniBank (DB) and Online bank values for Description, Amount, and Category (defaulting to DB description, online amount, and DB category), with full inline editability before confirmation.
  - Instantly updates and reconciles the target database transaction and clears the ghost suggestion from the pending sync queue.
- **Collapsible Bank Sync & Ghost Operations Box 👻**:
  - Made the ghost box dynamically collapsible across Dashboard and Timeline views: automatically expands when suggested new operations are present, collapses into a sleek summary header when only account balance discrepancies exist, and hides completely when everything is in sync.
  - Interactive toggle displays account balance breakdowns, delta adjustments, pending matches count, and quick action buttons (`Rapprocher`, `Valider`, `Ouvrir la revue`).
- **1-Click Quick Balance Gap Adjustment ⚡**:
  - Added an interactive 1-click modal on balance discrepancy badges (`⚠️ Difference : +X.XX € ⚡ Adjust`) allowing users to easily bridge unexplained balance gaps.
  - Supports two clean adjustment workflows: **Option A (Initial Balance)** to update starting balance without polluting history/charts, and **Option B (Interest / Regularization Entry)** to create a categorized reconciled transaction (ideal for savings account annual interest).
- **Performance & Data Pipeline Optimization ⚡**:
  - **Environment-Aware SQLite Journal Mode**: Restored high-concurrency `WAL` mode for packaged desktop builds while safely keeping `DELETE` mode for Docker/shared mounts, eliminating exclusive lock contention.
  - **Database Index Acceleration**: Added composite indexes on `transactions` (`date_operation`, `reconciliation_date, date_operation`, and `from_account_id, to_account_id, date_operation`) drastically speeding up transaction lookups and filtering.
  - **Fast Reconciliation Matching**: Replaced non-indexable SQL `julianday` dynamic ordering with range-indexed queries and in-memory proximity sorting, eliminating query bottlenecks during bank synchronization.
  - **Dashboard Balance Calculation Deduplication**: Reused precomputed reconciled balances across all dashboard sub-calculators (`net_worth`, `liquid_net_worth`, `rest_to_live`, and `overdraft_warning`), eliminating 4x redundant full transaction scans.
  - **Frontend Request Deduplication & Query Param Integrity**: Streamlined Overview banner pending sync loading and updated API inflight cache keys to properly separate distinct query parameters.
  - **Real-Time Bank Sync Animation Persistence**: Synchronized the "Relever en ligne" button pulsing and progress animation across all views, page navigations, scheduled background tasks, and browser reloads (F5) via backend status polling.

### Fixed
- **Desktop Bundle Woob Capabilities & Submodules Packaging**: Bundled all dynamic Woob capability modules (`woob.capabilities.bank`, `woob.browser.*`, `woob.tools.*`, `pycountry`, `html2text`, `yaml`, `unidecode`, `lxml`) into the PyInstaller desktop distribution, fixing `No module named 'woob.capabilities.bank'` when synchronizing bank accounts (e.g. Crédit Agricole `cragr`).
- **Background Scheduler Re-Matching DLL Contention Fix**: Removed redundant `pandas` runtime import inside `check_reconciliation`, eliminating `[WinError 206]` during recurring background transaction matching.
- **Bank Sync Vault Unlock via Notification Click**: Clicking a bank sync error notification caused by a locked vault or master password error now directly opens the master password unlock modal (`#masterPasswordModal`), allowing immediate in-place unlocking instead of attempting to open the pending transactions review modal.
- **Upcoming Ghost Operations Reconciliation Date**: Prevented automatic pre-filling of the reconciliation date when editing/adding an upcoming online transaction (`is_coming`), ensuring it remains unreconciled until posted by the bank.
- **Two-Pass Reconciliation Matching**: Resolved transaction matching collision between multiple operations with identical amounts and close dates by matching confirmed bank operations first, preventing pending authorizations from stealing reconciled history records.
- **Instant Ghost Reappearance on Database Deletion**: Fixed an `UnboundLocalError` in transfer mirror detection ensuring deleted database transactions immediately revert to ghost suggestions in the dashboard table.

- **Bank Sync Modular Refactoring 🏗️**:
  - Extracted the monolithic `bank_sync.js` (3100+ lines) into 5 focused sub-modules: `bank_sync_vault.js`, `bank_sync_pending.js`, `bank_sync_review.js`, `bank_sync_sync.js`, `bank_sync_connections.js`.
  - Full backward compatibility preserved via `Object.assign(window.BankSyncView, {...})` pattern.
- **SQLite Journal Mode Compatibility 💾**:
  - Unified journal mode to `DELETE` across all environments (local + Docker) to eliminate `.db-wal`/`.db-shm` lock conflicts on Docker Windows volume mounts.

  - **Single-Line Compact Header**: Streamlined top header bar into a single-row 52px layout on mobile ($\le 768\text{px}$) with hamburger menu ☰, centered logo 🏦, and profile badge + notification bell 🔔.
  - **Opaque Sticky Filter Bars**: Enhanced filter headers across History and Timeline views with solid background surfaces and drop shadows (`box-shadow`), eliminating card bleed during page scrolling.
  - **Fixed History Totals Footer**: Repositioned operations summary metrics (`OPÉRATIONS`, `DÉPENSES`, `RECETTES`, `TOTAL AFFICHIÉ`) into a fixed bottom bar anchored to the viewport in a compact 2×2 grid layout.
  - **Recurrences Mobile Card View**: Transformed the 11-column data table into responsive single-row card components (`.mobile-card-table`) with custom `data-label` cell formatting and an overflow-free scroll container (`.table-responsive`).
  - **Full-Width & Compact Recurrence Details**: Expanded unfolded template occurrence cards (`.rec-details-cell`) across 100% of mobile card width with a 320px scrollable container (`.rec-instances-list`).
  - **Reactive Detail Toggle (`toggleRow`)**: Fixed CSS specificity issue allowing expanded recurrence detail cards to toggle reactively on subsequent clicks.
- **Transaction Edit Modal Polish & Ergonomics 🛠️**:
  - **Fixed Footer Overflow**: Resolved primary save button truncation when *Keep Open*, *Clear Fields*, and *Delete Transaction* options are active.
  - **Action Label & Layout Optimization**: Shortened primary action button text to **"Enregistrer"** (`Save` in EN), expanded modal container width to `660px` max, and added responsive `flex-wrap` layout to fit all screen sizes smoothly.

## [1.0.75] - 2026-08-01

### Added & Improved
- **Multi-Master Profiles 👥**: Create and seamlessly switch between multiple completely isolated financial workspaces (Personal, Business, Association) on a single installation with 100% offline data sovereignty.
- **Custom Accent Colors & Live Preview 🎨**: Personalize each profile with custom theme accent colors, featuring real-time live preview without darkening the background interface.
- **Rich Profile Customization & Emoji Picker ⚙️**: Choose custom icons/emojis with an integrated emoji selector, configure main currency, default pay cycle day, date format, and export individual profile backups.
- **Instant Dynamic Updates ⚡**: Profile settings (pay day, currency, date formatting) apply immediately across the entire dashboard without requiring page reloads (F5).
- **Automatic Backup Settings Sync 🔄**: Restoring a database backup automatically synchronizes profile settings with your restored financial data.
- **Enhanced Security & Auto-Lock 🔒**: Protect individual profiles with an optional PIN code, auto-lock inactive sessions, and validate inputs using the `Enter` key.
- **Full Bilingual Support (EN / FR) 🌐**: Complete English and French localization across all profile configuration panels and cards.
- **Profile-Scoped & Global Backups 📦**: Export or restore individual master profiles or full application multi-profile backups in one click.

## [1.0.74] - 2026-07-30

### Added & Improved
- **Trends View Toolbar & Database Persistence 📈**:
  - Relocated **Alignment** dropdown ("Rolling" / "Calendar year") inline next to the "Superimpose years" switch in the header bar, keeping it permanently active across single-curve and superimposed modes.
  - Saved user view settings (`trends_superimpose`, `trends_alignment_type`, `trends_timeframe_months`, `trends_account_id`) directly in SQLite database via `/api/config` for instant cross-browser preference synchronization.
- **Budgets & Envelopes Refactoring 💼**:
  - Thread-safe AI status management in `budget_ai_service.py` via `threading.Lock` and non-blocking asynchronous calls to Ollama.
  - Unique DB index constraint on `Budget(name, envelope_type)` and check constraint `chk_budget_envelope_type`.
  - Automatic cleanup of orphan account IDs in `Budget.account_ids` when deleting an account (`accounts.py`).
  - Fragile closure pattern fix in `budget_service.py` (`_match_account` using default argument scope capture).
  - Externalization of inline styles from `budgets_render.js` to semantic CSS classes (`.bv-*`) in `style.css` (~120+ inline styles migrated).

## [1.0.73] - 2026-07-27

### Added
- **Transaction Form – Improved "Keep Open" mode 📋**:
  - New **"Clear fields"** badge-button (visible only when "Keep Open" is active): automatically clears the description, amount, category, check slip, attachments and budget fields after each save. State is persisted in `localStorage` independently from the "Keep Open" toggle.
  - "Keep Open" mode now also works in **edit mode**: the modal stays open after updating an existing transaction.
  - The **"Remove last entry"** button now appears below the toggles (second row) and is only shown after the first save in create mode.
  - In **edit mode**, that same button becomes **"🗑️ Delete transaction"** with an inline 2-click confirmation (first click → red alert state + auto-reset after 3 s, second click → delete + close modal).
- **Global button text centering 🎨**: added `display:inline-flex; align-items:center; justify-content:center` to the `.btn` class for perfect centering in all contexts (fixed height, asymmetric padding, etc.).

### Fixed & Improved
- **Accent-insensitive search 🔍**:
  - Search fields now ignore accents across the entire application (e.g. typing `peage` finds `Péage`).
  - Affected files: transaction add/edit form (`form.js`), category manager view (`categories_manager.js`), and multi-select component (`multi-select.js`).
  - Consistent use of `cleanStringForSearch()` (NFD normalisation + diacritic removal), already in place in the recurrence manager.
- **Transaction form footer**: refactored layout into a single row (compact toggles on the left, action buttons on the right with `white-space:nowrap`) — the "Save transaction" button is no longer clipped.
- **"Clear fields" state preserved**: toggling "Keep Open" from Off → On now restores the previous state of the "Clear fields" badge instead of resetting it.

## [1.0.72] - 2026-07-26

### Added
- **Analytics & PDF Export - Inactive Categories & Types 📊**:
  - Added "Show/Hide inactive categories" toggle per transaction type in the Synthèse view.
  - Added option to include inactive categories and completely inactive transaction types in PDF exports with full annual historical totals.
  - Exposed `inactive_types` data endpoint in backend stats API.

### Fixed & Improved
- **Analytics Summary Table Accuracy 🧮**:
  - Fixed annual column total sums so historical totals include all active/inactive categories across all years instead of truncating based on the filtered period.
- **PDF Export Rendering 📄**:
  - Removed container `max-height` and `overflow` CSS bounds in print mode to prevent table clipping.
  - Corrected `no-print` DOM filtering scope to preserve inactive rows and inactive type tables when requested.
  - Improved layout spacing between type tables in printed reports.

## [1.0.71] - 2026-07-25

### Added
- **Multi-Currency Support 💱**:
  - Real-time currency conversions, customizable exchange rates, multi-currency transaction/account support, and original currency badges.

  - API endpoint consolidation via `period_filter=all` single-query status batching and embedded `savings_overflow` inside `/api/budgets/capacity`.
  - Frontend parallelized category loading (`Promise.all`), eliminated `/api/stats/dashboard` dependency from Budgets view, and eliminated double DOM rendering.

### Fixed & Improved
- **AI Budget Wizard & Simulator UX 🧠**:
  - Preserved yearly/monthly period settings during envelope creation.
  - Smoothed historical estimations and enabled instant slider reactivity.
  - Graceful Ollama AI connection error handling, scale displays, and salary badges.

  - Fixed scroll issues during bulk budget envelope deletions.
- **Maintenance & i18n 🌐**:
  - Automated alphabetical sorting and key alignment across i18n files (FR / EN).
  - Removed frugal/austerity wording in favor of a neutral and supportive tone.

## [1.0.69] - 2026-07-19

### Added
- **Accent-Insensitive Search 🔍**: Implemented accent-insensitive and case-insensitive search capability across Dashboard (Timeline), Operations History, Recurrence templates, and Budget envelope categories.

### Fixed
- **Budget Envelope Category Selection bug 💰**: Resolved an issue where filtering categories during budget editing would cause hidden checked categories to be lost on save. Selection is now managed in JS state instead of relying purely on visible DOM elements.

## [1.0.68] - 2026-07-18

### Added
- **Global Activity & Undo System 🕓**: Full write operation tracking (CRUD) across all entities. Header undo/redo arrows, paginated "Actions" panel, and toast notifications for instant reversal.
- **Multi-Account Block Parsing 🏦**: Automatic segment extraction from concatenated multi-account bank exports (e.g. Crédit Agricole single-sheet exports with Livret A, LDD, etc.).
- **Match Confidence Index**: Confidence score (0-100%) with auto-parse above 50% and manual segment selection dropdown below 50%.
- **Import Modal Row Filters 🔍**: "All / To Add / To Reconcile" filter tabs in the import verification modal.
- **Import Validation Alerts 📥**: Duplicate, old file, gap (>3d), obsolescence (>7d), and account-change detection warnings on statement import.
- **AI Budget Summary Tool**: Consolidated `get_budgets_status` tool returning budgeted/spent/reconciled/remaining for AI reasoning.
- **AI Chat Auto-Scroll Lock**: Direction-aware lock with 30px bottom threshold to prevent accidental re-engagement.
- **AI Write Capabilities & Validation Queue (Human-in-the-Loop) 🔐**: 10 CRUD tools for Ollama — all writes are simulated, reviewed via side-by-side comparison modal, and only committed on explicit user validation.
- **i18n Improvements**: Migrated all AI action boxes, modals, and buttons to translation layer; refined French translations.
- **Improved AI Chat Context Compression**: New buffered compression with user feedback indicator ("Compression en cours..."), 90% threshold, and synced LLM summary call. Compressed summary appears as a collapsible bubble in the conversation timeline with inline editing, delete (reverts to raw sliding window), and regenerate (with custom instruction via dedicated modal). Fully non-destructive — all messages preserved in DB. Crash recovery resets stuck compression after 5 min.
- **Chat IA Cancellation Persistence**: Interrupted responses (either via new message stream, context regeneration, or message edits) now correctly display the cancel banner and persist in the database, surviving page refreshes (F5).
- **Stop Button on Message Edits**: The "Stop" button is now visible and fully functional when saving an edited user message.
- **Global Undo/Redo Header Synchronization**: Global Undo/Redo arrows in the header now update immediately upon any backend write operation (such as AI tool executions) or tab switches.
- **Friendly Tool Badges in Chat**: Replaced raw technical tool names on badges with localized friendly descriptions.
- **Tool Call Execution English Localization**: Localized status messages while the backend is executing tools when using the English interface.

### Fixed
- **Undo/Redo Tooltips i18n**: Action labels in undo/redo tooltips are now fully translated based on user language (was hardcoded in French from backend). Includes prepositional forms per language (FR: "de l'", "du", "de la" / EN: "of").

## [1.0.67] - 2026-07-16

### Added
- **Notification Center 🔔**: Integrated a notification menu in the top right of the main header to keep track of system updates and financial health reports.
- **Proactive Periodic Financial Reports (AI) 🧠**: Receive automated reports written in short summaries by the Ollama AI assistant. Reports include a visual status indicator (🟢, 🟡, 🔴) calculated based on current spendable balance, regular expenses, and anomalies.
- **1-Click Deep Dive 💬**: An option within financial report notifications lets you immediately launch a pre-populated AI chat session for detailed explanations about your report.
- **Privacy & Settings ⚙️**: Periodic reports are **disabled by default**. You can enable them and choose their frequency (daily, weekly, or monthly) at any time under the **Configuration (Ollama Settings)** tab.
- **Paycheck Rejection Assistant 💸**: New correction helper modal activated when rejecting a paycheck, suggesting alternate income candidates and allowing periods to be declared as unpaid.

### Fixed
- **Background notification on chat abandonment**: Implemented disconnected/detached handling of the SSE streaming connection (`_streamDetached`). The client continues receiving the response in the background without interrupting Ollama or causing SSE abort errors, ensuring reliable automated DB saves of the response.
- **Notification on generation completion**: Create a system notification `"AI Response Available 💬"` on the server only when the generation is fully finalized and the message is persisted. Clicking this notification redirects to the correct chat session with the full answer.
- **FastAPI dependency signature errors**: Corrected internal calls to `edit_message` and `regenerate` forwarding to `send_message` to explicitly pass the `db=db` parameter, preventing `Depends object has no attribute query` errors.
- **Notification panel UX**: Clicking a notification no longer abruptly closes the dropdown menu, and changes the cursor to default pointer style once marked as read.
- **12-Month Pay History Continuity 📅**: The history modal now displays all months without "holes" using placeholder records with a definition button.
- **Logical Cycle Start Date Calculation ⏰**: Fixed date range inversion caused by placeholder records erroneously shifting the cycle start date forward.
- **Targeted Period Validation 🎯**: Declaring a month as unpaid now correctly targets the chosen period with a 0 € override instead of defaulting to the active period.

## [1.0.66] - 2026-07-14

### Added
- **Timeline (Chronogramme) view for recurrences** with interactive month grids, day status badges (reconciled/skipped/pending), click-to-skip occurrences, and details panel expansion.
- **Improved Type Indicators**: Added 3px left borders with an outward glow effect (`box-shadow`) and dynamic type detection (resolving transfers like "Economie").
- **Sticky headers** in both table and chronogramme views for seamless scrolling.
- **Smart AI Chat scroll-lock** that suspends auto-scrolling if the user scrolls up during streaming.
- **Non-destructive skip mechanism** using a dedicated `is_skipped` transaction flag instead of zeroing out amounts.
- **Sanitization Wizard Enhancements**: Closure buttons directly in groups, and filtering of inactive templates.
- **Premium Recurrence Edit Modal** with 6-occurrence preview, yearly month selection, and unified transfer fields.
- **Enhanced Transaction Modal**: Added a direct "✏️ Modifier" button to edit recurrence templates from the transaction form, updated the "🔄 Récurrences" button to navigate to, scroll to, and highlight the corresponding recurrence row, and modernized the helper hint text to match these new features.
- **New Frequencies & Badges**: Added Weekly, Quarterly, and Semi-Annually options, sorting persistence, and status column.
- **Toast Notifications**: Stackable layout with z-index fixes.

### Changed
- Settings page loads Ollama models asynchronously to prevent freeze.
- Force-refresh occurrences on template edits.

## [1.0.65] - 2026-07-14

### Added
- **Recurrence Reconciliation Progress**:
  - Added a new **Progression** column in the recurrences table showing a visual progress bar (0-100%) of reconciled transactions for each recurrence template in the selected year.
  - Features premium styling with dynamic gradient colors: a success-green gradient (`#2ecc71` to `#27ae60`) for fully reconciled items (100%), and a modern accent-purple gradient otherwise.
  - Includes a text badge showing the percentage and reconciled count details (e.g., `75% (9/12)`).
  - Integrated full column sorting support (ascending and descending) for the progression values.

### Changed
- **Last Reconciled Transaction Amount Display**:
  - Updated the "Montant" column in the main recurrences table to display the amount of the latest reconciled transaction up to the selected year, falling back to the template default amount if no transactions have been reconciled yet.

## [1.0.64] - 2026-07-13

### Added
- **Cross-Browser History Month Filter**:
  - Replaced the inconsistent native `<input type="month">` with a dynamic `<select>` dropdown populated from unique database transaction months, ensuring full compatibility on Firefox and Safari.
  - Organized month options using `<optgroup>` year headers (e.g., `2026`, `2025`) and localized month names to dramatically reduce list height and visual clutter.
  - Added month navigation buttons (◀ and ▶) next to the select field, dynamically showing/hiding themselves based on navigable directions.
  - Synchronized and translated the `filter_all_months` key in both French and English locale files, preserving UTF-8 BOM encoding.

### Fixed
- **AI Chat Visual Pipeline & Error Capturing**:
  - Centralized bubble rendering inside a unified `formatMessageContent` helper to guarantee identical visual rendering (including spinners, collapsible thoughts, and cards) in both live streaming and history loading.
  - Secured the collapsible `🧠 Phase de réflexion` details view for reasoning models by using text-based placeholders (`___THINK_START___`) during markdown parsing to prevent DOMPurify from stripping custom tags.
  - Added a `1.0s` delay to tool status SSE events in the FastAPI backend to ensure live tool execution messages (like *"Interrogation du solde..."*) remain readable instead of disappearing instantly.
  - Resolved a critical silent error bug where streaming connection failures or empty responses were overwritten by the `finally` block reloading messages. Added a `hasError` guard to prevent database reloads when an error state is visible.

## [1.0.63] - 2026-07-13

### Fixed
- **Scoped Compact Mode Rules**:
  - Scoped all compact-mode table padding, button, and select overrides specifically to the `#recurrencesTableContainer` to prevent side effects on the dashboard and history tables.

## [1.0.62] - 2026-07-13

### Fixed
- **Recurrence Expanded Compact View**:
  - Reduced padding (`4px 8px`) and font size (`12px`) on inner input fields and rows when compact mode is active.
  - Fixed specificity bug on "Sauvegarder les modifications" (Save changes) button to preserve its legible size (`12px` font size and `4px 10px` padding) in compact mode.
  - Incremented stylesheet cache-buster query parameter to `v=7` to force instant update for all users.

## [1.0.61] - 2026-07-13

### Added
- **Recurrence Column Sorting**:
  - Interactive table headers (Description, Category, Frequency, Day, Amount, Annual Total) with visual sorting indicators (▲ / ▼).
  - Dynamic ascending and descending sort order persisted on `RecurrenceView`.
- **Integrated Changelog Viewer**:
  - Replaced single release notes popup with a scrollable list of all version releases parsed directly from the local `CHANGELOG.md` file (similar to Alanbix).
  - Docker volume mount for `CHANGELOG.md` to ensure synchronized updates.

## [1.0.60] - 2026-07-12

### Added
- **Comparative Trends Refactoring**:
  - Superimposed annual curves with calendar year (Jan 1st - Dec 31st) alignment and customizable year selector.
  - Redesigned Trends layout to display the chart and comparison table side-by-side on desktop viewports (70/30 split layout) and stacked on mobile viewports.
  - Compacted the comparison table by removing Min/Max columns to fit the side-by-side layout perfectly.
  - Introduced dynamic viewport height calculations (`calc(100vh - 330px)` / `calc(100vh - 400px)`) to fit Trends elements precisely without body or container scrollbars.
  - Interactivity & focus: clicking a year highlights its curve and dims other years, while updating stats cards dynamically.
  - Smooth X-axis zooming & panning using `chartjs-plugin-zoom` CDN, with a restyled "Reset Zoom" button.
  - Modern iOS-style toggle switch for the "Superpose years" checkbox.
- **Premium Recurrences View Redesign**:
  - Introduced 4 global stats cards (planned annual total, monthly average, active recurrence count, and reconciliation rate) at the top of the view.
  - Added a "Total annuel" column in the recurrence table showing the sum of actual operations for the selected year for each template.
  - Styled frequency columns using beautiful colored badges (blue for monthly, purple for yearly, green for bi-monthly).
  - Interactive chevron rotations (0 to 90 degrees) using smooth CSS transitions when unfolding recurrence instances.
- **System Polish**:
  - Implemented script load cache-busting version tags in `index.html`.

### Fixed
- Fixed table alignment on Trends page by wrapping blurred values in `<span>` tags rather than applying `privacy-blur` to `<td>` tags.
- Fixed year filtering initialization bug where unchecking a year initially failed to update the chart/table.
- Fixed SQLite database operational errors (disk I/O error) on WSL2/Docker volume mounts on Windows/NTFS by wrapping pragmas in robust exception handlers and falling back to DELETE rollback journal mode.
- Removed outdated and irrelevant "Other months" compare option for a cleaner, unified workspace.

## [1.0.59] - 2026-07-12

### Added
- Chat IA Premium: Double-column layout with sidebar for conversation sessions and main chat window.
- Context Compaction: AI context is dynamically compressed under a configurable threshold to fit in context window.
- Conversation Session persistence: selected conversation session and its precise scroll position are remembered (via sessionStorage) across tab switches.
- Added transaction duplication feature: duplicate any existing transaction with a single click (📋 button) pre-filling the entry form with today's date.
- Added "16K" quick setting option in config context size panel.
- System message endpoint `POST /api/chat/sessions/{id}/system-message` to add feedback messages without triggering AI generations.

### Fixed
- Fixed UI overlap bugs by moving message action buttons from absolute positioning to inline block elements inside bubbles.
- Fixed empty stream bug: chat UI now displays an explicit error message instead of failing silently when Ollama doesn't return content.
- Fixed stream delivery on non-tool routes: response is stream-chunked in all paths for a smooth rendering experience.
- Fixed XSS vulnerability: user message texts are now properly escaped with HTML entities.
- Fixed token usage indicator: correctly initialises based on the server's real Ollama config instead of defaulting to 4096.
- Fixed loop bug in session creation when no sessions exist.
- Fixed bubble edit size & look-and-feel: inline bubble text editor matches the exact width of the message bubble and uses a cleaner theme-integrated border.

## [1.0.58] - 2026-07-05

### Added
- English localization: translated 40+ remaining French-only keys in `en.json` (system prompts, category manager labels, UI fallbacks). Community contribution by [@Lloir](https://github.com/Lloir) (PR #1).
- Dynamic `<html lang>` attribute: now automatically reflects the user's selected language instead of being hardcoded.

### Fixed
- Fixed Docker image missing `/app/static` directory, causing `FileNotFoundError` crash on standalone deployments (e.g. Unraid) that don't use volume mounts.
- Reverted AI chat prompts (`chat.py`) to use French locale — the PR had hardcoded English, breaking the AI assistant for French-speaking users.

### Improved
- Budget envelope creation now scrolls to and highlights the new card with a glowing accent animation for visual confirmation.
- Added `.idea/`, `.vscode/` and other IDE config directories to `.gitignore` to prevent future contributors from accidentally committing editor settings.
## [1.0.57] - 2026-07-01

### Fixed
- Fixed implicit account pre-selection in the transaction entry form: browsers were silently pre-selecting the first account in the listbox, causing the inferred transaction type to default to `expense_var` instead of `neutral`, which incorrectly displayed variable expense categories before any account was chosen.
- Fixed SQLite `database is locked` errors (HTTP 500) occurring when multiple API endpoints are called concurrently on page load. Configured a 30-second busy timeout in SQLAlchemy connection args.
- Fixed transfer transactions showing an empty category dropdown. The "Compte vers compte" category was stored with type `neutral` instead of `transfer`. Added schema migration v5 to automatically reclassify all `neutral` categories as `transfer` on startup, ensuring correct behaviour for all users without manual intervention.
- Fixed "Neutre" category group in the Category Manager incorrectly appearing with transactions in the Synthesis view due to wrong category type assignment.

### Changed
- Categories of type `neutral` and `transfer` are now strictly separate in the transaction entry form. Each transaction type only shows its own matching categories.

## [1.0.56] - 2026-06-25

### Added
- Added manual `is_salary` flag to transactions (controllable via checkbox on income transaction edits).
- Added quick settings configurable pay category filter and minimum paycheck percentage threshold.
- Added a "Reject" (❌) action directly in the paycheck history modal (`payHistoryModal`) to quickly exclude false-positive paycheck detections.
- Added "piggy bank overflow" visual logic: when rest-to-live becomes negative, the amount color-codes to orange (consuming savings) or red (savings fully consumed). Savings progress bars in the sidebar, budget cards, savings summaries, and the budget details modal display dual-fill bars showing both theoretical and effective savings levels along with a negative badge showing the temporarily borrowed amount.
- Added date adjustment shortcuts (`◀` / `▶`), a today button (`📅`), and a clear button (`✕` for reconciliation date) positioned and distributed evenly directly below the date input fields in the transaction entry modal.
- Added dynamic button label translation (renaming "Annuler" to "Fermer") when "Garder ouvert" is active, persisted the keep-open toggle setting in local storage, and preserved all entered form fields upon saving when keep-open is on.
- Improved modal styling by expanding width to 580px and disabling flex-wrap on the footer to keep "Fermer" and "Enregistrer" buttons locked in place when the undo button appears.

### Changed
- Improved paycheck detection algorithm to ignore non-salary incomes using the new configurable threshold (defaults to 30% of average historical paycheck) and optional category filter, preventing small income transactions from advancing the pay period.
- Enhanced backup restoration process to automatically re-run database schema migrations (`init_db()`), preventing backend 500 errors when restoring legacy backups lacking newly introduced columns like `is_salary`.

## [1.0.55] - 2026-06-21

### Changed
- Optimized backend database query performance:
  - Restricted transaction loading in budget status calculations to only search within active budget date ranges (e.g. current year/month/custom ranges) rather than retrieving the entire history.
  - Optimized account balance queries to select only necessary columns (`amount`, `from_account_id`, `to_account_id`) to bypass expensive SQLAlchemy object hydration overhead.
  - Optimized paycheck prediction queries by fetching only required columns.
  - Resulted in a 5x to 15x speedup for dashboard stats and accounts endpoints, dropping reload times to under 100ms.

## [1.0.54] - 2026-06-21

### Changed
- Optimized Nginx configuration (`nginx.conf`) for Docker image / Unraid setups:
  - Enabled HTTP Keep-Alive for API routes by dynamically mapping the connection upgrade header.
  - Disabled Nginx proxy buffering (`proxy_buffering off;`) to avoid writing large API responses to disk, resolving major UI latency issues on Unraid/FUSE filesystems.
  - Enabled Gzip compression for proxied dynamic backend responses (`gzip_proxied any;`) to reduce bandwidth and speed up page load times.
